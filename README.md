# Data Structures
<p align="justify">
This repository holds the implementation of various Sorting, Searching and Data Structures written in the C programming language, based on a course named <em>Data Structures</em>, that I completed during my second year of studies in the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department at the University of Patras.

# Structure
<p align="justify">
In the Sorting folder, you can find the implementations of popular sorting algorithms in the C programming language, and the folder is structured as such:
  <ul>
    <li><em>Bubble Sort.c:</em> The implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>Insertion Sort.c:</em> The implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>Selection Sort.c:</em> The implementation of the selection sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>Merge Sort.c:</em> The implementation of the merge sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>Quick Sort.c:</em> The implementation of the quick sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>Heap Sort.c:</em> The implementation of the heap sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>All Sorts Timed.c:</em> All the algorithms put to the test, and individually timed to confirm the best.</li>
  </ul>

<br />

In the Searching folder, you can find the implementations of popular searching algorithms in the C programming language, and the folder is structured as such:
  <ul>
    <li><em>Linear Search.c:</em> The implementation of the linear search.</li>
    <li><em>Binary Search.c:</em> The implementation of the binary search. It also has the Quick Sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>Interpolation Search.c:</em> The implementation of the interpolation search and the Quick Sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>Binary Interpolation Search.c:</em> The binary version of the interpolation search, along with the Quick Sort algorithm.</li>
    <li><em>All Searches Timed.c:</em> All the algorithms put to the test, and individually timed to confirm the best.</li>
  </ul>
  
<br />

In the BST & HashTable folder, you can find the implementations of a Binary Search Tree and a HashTable in the C programming language, used to hold information regarding students and their grades, and the folder is structured as such:
  <ul>
    <li><em>BST and HashTable.c:</em> The implementation of both Data Structures.</li>
    <li><em>Students.txt:</em> The data used to fill the BST and the HashTable.</li>
  </ul>
